Welcome to TGE's Code of Conduct website!

Let's get to the bottom of this..

The new Rojo website uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator focused on building great documentation websites.

The bulk of the work on this project was done by [TiagoLobo19](https://github.com/TiagoVXII). Send them your thanks the next time you see them!
