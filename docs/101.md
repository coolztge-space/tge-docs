Clone armor is one of the most notable features within the Galactic Republic. This directive will explain the regulations on clone armor.

Authority

The Coruscant Guard are responsible for the enforcement on the type of armor you wear. The Coruscant Guards hold the right to detain those who wear the wrong armor or impersonate a rank. Division personnel may wear regular white phase 2 armor except for the Red Guard, Senate Guard, and Republic Intelligence unless given permission by HICOM.

Customs

Custom bought armor from the Kamino Armorsmith (Closed) is allowed to be worn on Coruscant. You may not wear custom armor attending events as a divisional or hosting one. Custom armor cannot be an exact copy of a division morph.
